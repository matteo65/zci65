# zci65
Fast, secure, efficent stream cipher

Zci65 uses a 32-byte key and does not use a Initialization Vector (IV); the algorithm use a internal 256 length array s[] of 32 bit integer and other 2 internal 32 bit fields, k and c; in total the state size is 1088 bytes.
The internal state is continuously changed by the source content to be encrypted.
The code is very simple, the main functions are:
```java	
public byte encipher(byte b) {
	int p = ((k >>> 24) ^ (k >>> 16) ^ (k >>> 8) ^ k) & 0xFF;
	int r = s[p];
	s[p] = k ^ (r * 5);
	k = s[(b + c++) & 0xFF] ^ (k * 5);
	return (byte)((r >>> 24) ^ (r >>> 16) ^ (r >>> 8) ^ r ^ b);
}

public byte decipher(byte b) {
	int p = ((k >>> 24) ^ (k >>> 16) ^ (k >>> 8) ^ k) & 0xFF;
	int t = s[p];
	s[p] = k ^ (t * 5);
	int r = ((t >>> 24) ^ (t >>> 16) ^ (t >>> 8) ^ t ^ b) & 0xFF;
	k = s[(r + c++) & 0xFF] ^ (k * 5);
	return (byte)r;
}
```
The main properties of a good encryption algorithm are:

1. Produce an output indistinguishable from a random sequence of bytes 
2. Do it in the shortest possible time (and this is especially true for a stream cipher) 
3. Make it impossible to predict the output sequence starting from the data already produced.

Point 1 can be verified with statistical analyses; point 2 by measuring the times and comparing them with benchmark values, while point 3 can only be verified by an independent cryptographic analysis and therefore I invite the researchers to consider zci65 and confirm or deny this feature

Zci65

### The output stream produced by the encryption has a uniformly random distribution
To compare the quality of the random distribution of the output, the encryption output streams of two algorithms were analyzed and compared: Salsa20 and SecRnd (a simple, but slow algorithm that generates a secure random sequence based on SHA-256 which puts exclusive with the input stream)
